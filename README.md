## Overview

-insert screenshot-

Audiofile is a resource that allows a user to organize and plan their vinyl library so they can keep track of what they own and plan what they would like to add to their library in the future.

As someone who recently got into vinyl, I wanted to build a platform to bring my library on-the-go with me.  As a library grows, it becomes harder to remember what's in your collection already.  This platform helps bridge the gap between your home and your favorite local record stores.


### Features

Audiofile is your complete vinyl resource, touching on all elements of building and maintaining your collection.
